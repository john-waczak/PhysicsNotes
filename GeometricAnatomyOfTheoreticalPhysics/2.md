## 1.4 The $\in$-Relation
Set theory is build on the postulate that there is a fundamental relation (i.e. a predicate of 2 variables) called $\in$. There is no definition (in the strict sense) of what $\in$ is apart from it being *some* predicate of 2 variables or of what a *set* is. Instead, 9 axioms that speak of $\in$ and sets.  

### Overview of the Axioms 
Basic existence axioms
- E
- E

Construction axioms
- P
- U
- R
- P

Further existence axioms (also construction axioms)
- I 
- C

Axiom of *Foundation* (more of a non-existence axiom)
- F

Using the $\in$-relation, we can immediately define
\begin{align}
    x \notin y &:\Leftrightarrow \neg(x\in y) \\ 
    x\subseteq y &:\Leftrightarrow \forall a: \; (a\in x \Rightarrow a \in y) \\ 
    x = y &\Leftrightarrow x \subseteq y \wedge y \subseteq x
\end{align}


## 1.5 Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms of Set Theory

### (E) Axiom on $\in$-Relation
\begin{equation}
    x\in y 
\end{equation}
is a proposition if and only if $x$ and $y$ are both sets.
   
\begin{equation}
    \forall x: \forall y: \; (x\in y)  \not\vee \neg(x \in y)
\end{equation}
   
   
### Counter example (Russel)
Assume there is some $u$ that contains all sets that do not contain themselves as an element. To be precise, 
\begin{equation}
    \exists u: \; \forall z: \; \left(z \in u \Leftrightarrow z \notin z \right)
\end{equation}  

Question: Is $u$ a set?   

NO! If $u$ was a set, we must be able to decide whether $u\in u$ is true or false.  

Assume that $u\in u$ is true:  $\Rightarrow u\notin u$ by definition of $u$ (contradiction)

Assume that $u\in u$ is false:  then $u\notin u$ $\Rightarrow$ $u\in u$ (contradiction)  

Conclusion: $u$ is **not** a set.

### (E) Axiom on Existence of an Empty Set
There exists a set that contains **no** elements.
\begin{equation}
    \exists x: \forall y: y\notin x
\end{equation}

**Theorem**: There is only one empty set, call it $\emptyset$  
**(pf)**: textbook-style: assume $x$ and $x'$ are both empty sets. If that's true, I may write 
\begin{equation}
    \forall y: \; y\in x \Rightarrow y\in x'
\end{equation}
but this just means by definition that $x\subseteq x'$. Conversely, 
\begin{equation}
    \forall y: \; y\in x' \Rightarrow y \in x
\end{equation}
so that $x'\subseteq x$. Thus we conclude by definition of $=$ that $x=x'$.

### (P) Axiom on Pair Sets
Let $x$ and $y$ be sets. Then there exists a set that contains as its elements precisely the sets $x$ and $y$.  

\begin{equation}
    \forall x: \forall y: \exists M: \forall u:(u\in M \Leftrightarrow u=x \vee u=y)
\end{equation}

**Notation**: denote the set $M$ by $\{x, y\}$.  

Worry: is $\{x, y\} = \{y, x\}$? It is! 
\begin{align}
    a\in\{x, y\} &\Rightarrow a \in \{y, x\} \\ 
    a\in\{y, x\} &\Rightarrow a \in \{x, y\} \\ 
    &\Rightarrow  (\{x, y\} \subseteq \{y, x\}) \wedge (\{y, x\} \subseteq \{x, y\}) \\ 
    &\Rightarrow \{x, y\} = \{y, x\}
\end{align}
In other words, the order doesn't matter.  

**Remark/Def**: for a set $x$,  $\{x\}:= \{x, x\}$

### (U) Axiom on Union Sets
Let $x$ be a set. Then there exists a set $u$ whose elements are precisely the elements of the elements of $x$. 

**Notation**: $u = \bigcup x$  

Let $a, b, c$ be sets. Then 
\begin{align}
    &\Rightarrow x := \{\{a\}, \{b\} \} \\ 
    &\Rightarrow \bigcup x = \{a, b\}
\end{align}
Second example: 
\begin{align}
    &x = \{\{a\}, \{b, c\}\} \\ 
    &\Rightarrow \bigcup x \text{ is a set} \\ 
    &=: \{a ,b ,c\}
\end{align}

**Def**: Let $a_1, ... , a_N$ be sets. Define recursively for $N\geq 3$
\begin{equation}
    \{a_1, ... , a_n\} := \bigcup \{\{a_1,...,a_{N-1}\}, \{a_N\}\}
\end{equation}

### (R) Axiom of Replacement
Let $R$ be a **functional relation**. Let $m$ be a set. Then the image of $m$ under the functional relation $R$ is again a set.  

Here a relation is called functional if 
\begin{equation}
    \forall x: \exists ! y : R(x, y)
\end{equation}

The image of a set $m$ under functional relation $R$ consists of all those $y$ for which there is an $x\in m$ such that $R(x, y)$.  

The axiom of replacement implies (but is not implied by) **the principle of restricted comprehension**: Let $P$ be a predicate of 1 variable and $m$ a set. Then those elements $y\in m$ for which $P(y)$ is true constitute a set. This set is denoted 
\begin{equation}
    \{ y \in m \; | \; P(y)\}
\end{equation}
This principle of restricted comprehension is not to be confused with the **inconsistent** principle of universal comprehension
\begin{equation}
    \{y \; | \; p(y)\} \text{  is a set}
\end{equation}
The key difference is that $y$ is already assumed to live in a set $m$.

**(pf)**: Case 1  
$\neg \exists y \in m: \; P(y)$. In this case we define
\begin{equation}
    \{y \in m \; | \; P(y)\} := \emptyset
\end{equation}

Case 2  
$\exists \hat{y} \in m : P(\hat{y})$. Then define
\begin{equation}
    R(x, y) := \left( P(x) \wedge x = y \right) \vee \left(\neg P(x) \wedge \hat{y}=y \right)
\end{equation}
is functional. Then define 
\begin{equation}
    \{y \in m \; | \; P(y)\} := \text{Im}_R(m)
\end{equation}

**Def**: Let $u\subseteq m$, then 
\begin{equation}
    m\setminus u := \{ x \in m \; | \; x \notin u\}
\end{equation}
is a set.

**Def**: Let $x$ be a set. Define 
\begin{equation}
    \bigcap x := ... \text{  (homework)}
\end{equation}
as the intersection

### (P) Axiom on Existence of Power Sets
In naive set theory, the principle of universal comprehension was thought to be needed in order to define for any set $m$,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(m) := \{ y \; | \; y\subseteq m \}
\end{equation}
but we can not tell which *bigger* set these subsets come from. This is *bad*. Instead:  

Let $m$ be a set. Then there exists a set denoted $\mathcal{P}(m)$ whose elements are precisely the subsets of $m$.  

*ex*: let $m=\{a, b\}$. Then $\mathcal{P}(m) = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\}\}$. It turns out we can not argue that this is set. We need to declare it is one *axiomatically*.

### (I) Axiom of Infinity
There exists a set that contains the empty set and with every of its elements $y$ it also contains $\{ y\}$ as an element.  

**Remark**: One such set is, informally speaking, the set with the elements
\begin{equation}
    \{ \emptyset, \{\emptyset\}, \{\{\emptyset\}\}, \{\{\{\emptyset\}\}\}, ...\}
\end{equation}
this is annoying to write, so we introduce the *notation*
\begin{equation}
    \{0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}
\end{equation}

**Corollary**: The set of non-negative integers, $\mathbb{N}$, is a set. (also known as the *natural* numbers)  

**Remark**: As a set, $\mathbb{R}$ may be understood as $\mathbb{R}:= \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.


### (C) Axiom of Choice
Let $x$ be a set whose elements are 
- non-empty 
- mutually disjoint (i.e. $x_i\cap x_j = \emptyset$)
then there exists a set $y$ which contains exactly one element of each element of $x$.

**Remark**: Some people say $y$ is a *dark set*. There is no clear prescription for how to pick elements of $x$. 

**Remark**: The axiom of choice is independent of the other 8 axioms. We could have set theories with or without the axiom of choice.

**Remark**: Theorems that require the axiom of choice
- the proof that every vector space has a basis
- the proof that there exists a complete system of representatives of an equivalence relation


### (F) Axiom of Foundation
Every non-empty set $x$ contains an element $y$ that has non of its elements in common with $x$.  

**Immediate implication**: There is no set that contains itself as an element, i.e. $x\in x .
